### Vulnerable Code

```java
contract Accounting {
    using DSMath for uint;
    bool internal _in;
    modifier noReentrance() {
        require(!_in);
        _in = true;
        _;
        _in = false;
    }
    ...
}
```

### Description

This contract uses noReentrance() to keep code from reentrant access. However, there exists a loose limitation on the bool variable _in, which can cause an access control vulnerability because the checks in noReentrance() depends on it.

The variable _in is limited by internal modifier, the access to this variable will not be passed unless it inherits this contract. The contract inherited this vulnerable one can easily change this value, thus leaves the possible ineffectiveness of the access check of noReentrance().

###  Suggestions

Use private modifier to limit the accessibility of the _in variable.
