### Vulnerable Code

### Description

We found this contract has a possible ineffectiveness in time check. In line 23, this contract has a time check (in line 335 for real code). This check relies on the value of the member auctionEnd. However, the auctionEnd is assigned in line 12 (in line 228 for real code) by an argument _duration. This function is feasible for public access and there's no argument check on this _duration variable. If a very large number is assigned to _duration, the time check in line 23 will be easily passed.

### Suggestions

Check the _duration value before assign it to auctionEnd.
